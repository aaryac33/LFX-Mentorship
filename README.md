Step 1: Set up your Rust environment

Step 2: Create a new Rust project: Use Cargo to initialize a new Rust project. Open a terminal and run the following command: 'cargo new rust_login_function --bin'
This will create a new Rust project named "rust_login_function" with a binary target.

Step 3: Add dependencies: Open the Cargo.toml file in your project folder and add the actix-web dependency:
[dependencies]
actix-web = "3.3.2"

Write the login function: In the src/main.rs file, you can define your login function using actix-web: 'python file for which is added'

Build and run the server: Run the following command to build and start the server: 'cargo run'

The server should now be running on http://127.0.0.1:8080, ready to accept HTTP POST requests to the /login endpoint.(ip address subject to change)

Now, your Rust server is up and running, and you can send POST requests to http://127.0.0.1:8080/login with JSON data containing username and password fields. The server will respond with the login status in JSON format.
